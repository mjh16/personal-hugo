![Me and Mardi] (/img/IMG_0665.jpg)
Hello, my name is Michael. I like to run, cook, drink coffee, bake bread, and brew beer. I am a first year PhD in Rhetoric and Composition at [Florida State University] (http://english.fsu.edu/rhetcomp/index.html). Prior to that I received my MA at [The University of Nebraska at Omaha] (https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/english/) and my BA in English from [Creighton University] (http://www.creighton.edu/ccas/english/). I am interested in pedagogy, creative nonfiction, rhetoric, visual rhetoric, design, play, TA training, and many other things that Iâ€™m unsure of. When I'm not doing any of those things, you can probably find me on a porch reading, or perhaps gaming.

I enjoy trail running, and there will be some posts here about that from time to time. It is something where I've been able to find a real peace in and with myself. I also enjoy the challenge and the beauty that it can offer. Tallahassee has some wonderful trails, and I've been doing my best to get out and enjoy them.

This site will largely be for my own personal musing, and for showcasing and presenting projects that I'm working on that are not as directly related to my academic pursuits. It is a place to share some of the stuff that I've been enjoying, and to play around with new tools and technologies.

This site has been built with [Hugo] (http://gohugo.io) and uses the [Beautiful Hugo Theme] (http://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/). I've been working to keep the site as minimal as possible, following the [Minimal Computing] (http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) working group of [Global Outlook::Digital Humanities] (http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/). I am also using this site to better know and understand that tools and technologies that I use.
