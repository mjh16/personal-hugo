Hello, my name is Michael and I don’t have my own room. Seriously, my bed is in the family room and my “office” is in an unfinished storage room by the furnace. However this is an about me and there will be more on that later. I moved back home due to a mix of reasons in my late 20s and still live there. I have had to take up a number of household duties, and I’ve found myself navigating new expectations and realities in a world that assumes that I should have grown up, moved out, and found my own life by now.

What I have had are adventures in beer brewing, growing closer to my mother, cooking, creating a new relationship with my father, lacto-fermentation, feeling distanced from my brother, pickling, dealing with mental illness, grilling, falling in love, canning, traveling, hot-sauce making, running, writing, traveling, graduate school, teaching, and learning me.

I started college in 2002 as a biology major with a pre-med focus at Fairfield University in Fairfield Connecticut. In February of 2004 my father had a severe stroke that left him disabled and aphasic and flipped my family on its head. After taking the scenic route I graduated from Creighton University in Omaha NE with my BA in English (with a creative writing specialization) in 2010. I returned to the University of Nebraska – Omaha in 2013 to start work on pre-requisites for getting my teaching certificate in secondary education. Along the way Dr. Kennedy told me that I would be a TA and English master’s student; that’s how I’ve ended up here, loving my work, and where I am headed.

I see this blog as a way for me to share my experiences, the recipes that I have learned and developed along the way, give some insight to my world, and to bring some dignity to moving back home. It was not an easy decision but it is one that I do not regret at all. Through this process I have had to learn to live without one parent, to become in many ways the father figure to my younger siblings, and to become a larger partner and participant at home. Because of these shifting dynamics I have also learned how to cook for a family, plan out meals and menus, and balance my personal, family, and educational goals and aspirations.<figure id="attachment_12" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
