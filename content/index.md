Welcome to my personal space web space. Here you can find my [blog] (/blog/), [recipes] (/recipes/), and to things that I've [composed] (/compositions/ "mostly non-academic Creative Nonfiction"). There is also a link to my [academic space] (http://michaelhealy.space/academic/), which details my publications, presentations, research, and class projects. I've set up the two seperately so that each has a unique look and feel, and that I can best keep track of the two.

So, welcome, have a look around. I'll be adding some bread recipes soon, as well as updating some of the rest. If you are here looking for my CV, or presentation notes, that can be found under the academic tab.
