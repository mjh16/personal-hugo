So I&#8217;m currently in Minneapolis for the 2015 [awp conference][1] and am having a marvelous time. The picture above is of the bookfair on Thursday morning before it got super crazy. That place has been an overwhelming and amazing experience. I&#8217;ve only walked through maybe a third of it so far between sessions. I plan to spend more time there tomorrow.

Today I got to see some very interesting panels on video essays and things that I actually really enjoy writing and doing, so that was good. It was especially enlightening to hear [Eula Biss][2] and [John Breslan ][3]talk process for drafting and editing video essays. While I still don&#8217;t agree with all of their choices in their work, having the opportunity to look behind the curtain gave me a deeper understanding and context that I didn&#8217;t get from viewing the work online.

While stressful in the context of this spring, the conference has been really enlightening and productive. I&#8217;ve especially enjoyed the work that I&#8217;ve seen and heard that tease, in productive ways, at the same borders and boundaries that I&#8217;m interested in. I&#8217;m glad to see that there are others mining the same grey area. <span style="line-height: 28px;"> </span>

I&#8217;ve also been able to drink some good local beer, so that&#8217;s been awesome.
