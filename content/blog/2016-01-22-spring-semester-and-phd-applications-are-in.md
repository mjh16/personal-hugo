Long time, no update. It&#8217;s now the second week of the semester, and it feels like there is a lot that has been accomplished and a lot still left to do.

All of the PhD applications are in! So that is a great feeling. I think that I hit submit on the last one around this time last week. So here&#8217;s to playing the waiting game. It feels good to have things out of my control and know that I did everything to make my applications the best possible. There is always room to wonder how things may have gone differently, but I think I&#8217;m a good candidate and that things will work out well. Here&#8217;s to hoping that Jessi and I get to make some choices for where to move this spring.

I think this will be just a short update for now. There is more I want to write about, and more that I have to make a habit to write about, but things are good.
