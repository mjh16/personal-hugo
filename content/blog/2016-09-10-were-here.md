Well we are all doing alright, although we still have to settle into life here in Florida. It&#8217;s going to be a good adventure, I&#8217;m just not entirely sure what it will all look like yet.

So far Jessi and I are doing well, pup is good, our teaching has been going super awesome, and the classes we are taking are going to be great. Now, if we could just figure out parking.
