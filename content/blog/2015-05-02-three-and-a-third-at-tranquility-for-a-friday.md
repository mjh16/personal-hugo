I was excited about being able to get out for a run yesterday. I spent most of last summer and much of the fall running trails with the <a href="http://www.irunwithgoats.org" target="_blank">GOATZ</a> at places like Tranquility, Swanson,Lewis and Clark, Hitchcock, and others. These are all parks in the Greater Omaha Area that have dirt trails that are great for running. Through the <a href="http://www.irunwithgoats.org" target="_blank">GOATZ</a> I&#8217;ve met a bunch of awesome people who pushed me into the best shape of my life. It ended up with me running the <a href="http://goodlifehalfsy.com" target="_blank">Good Life Halfsy</a> last fall in a 1:52:39, a personal record in that distance by over 7 minutes, or at least 30 seconds per mile faster. For me, it was huge and was a great accomplishment.

So imagine my disappointment with not running much and running even fewer trails this winter. The combination of the harsh weather, three classes, teaching, and life busy-ness all amounted to me running a few times per week, at most, on the indoor track at school. I really haven&#8217;t done much at all during the month of April. With the weather now getting super nice and the semester winding down I decided to go for a run at one of my favorite places, <a href="http://www.trailshaveourrespect.org/trail-information/tranquility-park/" target="_blank">Tranquility Park</a>. I went in the afternoon and just about had the place to myself, only ever seeing one biker out there.<figure id="attachment_40" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

It was really great to be able to get out into nature and go for a run. I did an easy 3.3 miles around the north loop. It is a relatively flat piece of dirt single track that goes traverses open fields, woods, and next to some wetlands. There is a little elevation change but it is gradual. It is also one of the first trails that I ever ran and it is a favorite of mine. I think I most like Tranquility because it is close, has a variety of scenery, lots of animals, and it can be broken up into three sections that are all a little over three miles a piece. It makes going out to do an approximately 3, 6, or 10 mile run really simple. It is also fairly easy with some good hills.

I really love to run and especially fell in love with trail running because of the challenge and the accomplishment that it gives me. I love how I can physically see the changes that the hours and miles of dirt have sculpted into my body. I love being able to actually feel and see myself get faster and stronger. And I just really love being able to do it, on dirt, in nature, and feel really connected for a while. It is an active thinking time for me that I really value, and that I really have missed this winter.

It felt good and I&#8217;m only a little sore today. Getting back out on the trails are something that will happen this summer. I&#8217;ve already started to figure out just where and what I want to do. I&#8217;m even working on a video essay about trail running. I&#8217;ll link to it here once I know what I am doing with it in the long term.
