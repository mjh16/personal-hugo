Hey everyone! Sorry about the long delay, the end of the semester and the beginning of the summer have been fun, busy, and adventure filled. I&#8217;ve also had some idea of how this blog will shape and evolve over the next few months as I do intend to keep updating and adapting it.

Here is a preview of some of the thing that I intend to write about: Trip to Colorado, seeing The Mountain Goats, running the 2015 Bolder Boulder, getting back into running, pizza, bacon, running, salads, gardening, peppers, golf, soup, beer, and the general trajectory of life. In addition I am looking forward to seeing how I can evolve this blog to serve as a bit more than a food blog and to be more of an exploration of my life, which includes food, and the other things with my Master&#8217;s program, research, thesis, and applying for PhD programs.

So, look forward for new things to come!
