I found an old post sitting in drafts, and it made me realize that I have really been meaning to keep up with this whole blog thing, at least somewhat regularly. I mean, it is part of the reason that I have the site, right? It is a good place to keep my various digital projects, and I need to upload a CV, but I want it to be more than just that sort of digital clearinghouse. I want to do more with this page, and to have it inhabit the sort of in-between spaces that I inhabit in my work and studies.

So, a new post, wanting to cross between the academic&#8211;the piles of work that I could be doing, but am not&#8211;and the everyday. I&#8217;ve found that I&#8217;m starting to discern where I want to go with this whole PhD thing, and to consider, more specifically, what those areas are and how they interact. I know that I still want to work with creative nonfiction in my work, regardless of context. I also want to continue to weave creative writing into my theory, pedagogy, and curriculum. I&#8217;ve had an immense amount of luck, all anecdotal, this semester with both in my teaching, and I hope some in my work.

I have some projects that are brewing that I&#8217;m excited about, but nothing to share here until I have some proposals out and perhaps some drafts composed. But it is all exciting work, and here&#8217;s a preview: at least 2 conference proposals, a research proposal, a class design, a collaborative article, sending out some CNF pieces to journals, and sending out an article. And this is all in addition to my grading, reading, and writing this semester!

Tallahassee continues to be a wonderful place to be, and Florida State is fan-fucking-tastic. I have thoroughly enjoyed my cohort, my classes, the readings groups, the speakers, and my students. It has been challenging overall, but I am so so so happy that we chose to move here. The weather, parks, food, and beer have also certainly helped. We&#8217;ve been able to find some good places to be and some good things to do.

[CCCC 2017 in Portland][1] was cold, rainy, and wonderful. I had my first ever concurrent-session talk and it went great. We probably had ~25 people in attendance, had a lively discussion, and I didn&#8217;t throw up!

Well, I&#8217;m procrastinating, and I&#8217;ve got my first [official 10k][2] for the year (and first organized race in Tallahassee) in the morning. So, here&#8217;s to a good 6.2 miles.
