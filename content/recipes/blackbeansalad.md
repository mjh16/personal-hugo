I often find myself cooking for myself and the family. One of the largest adjustments over the past year has been my schedule as a graduate student and teaching assistant. This has led to me having odd hours and not being around as often to cook. Out of this I have made a number of recipes that are quick, easy, flavorful, and pack well as leftovers. This is a barley salad that I made to have as a cold option for lunches throughout a school week. It is very flavorful and accidentally vegan. I do not adhere to any specific diet but I do like variety and I like to use fresh ingredients. I will be doing seasonal recipes as well once the farmer's markets and my own garden get going this summer.
