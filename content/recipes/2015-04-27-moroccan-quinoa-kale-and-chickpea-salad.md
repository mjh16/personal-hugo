It is that time of year again, when the paper deadlines are here, there are papers to grade, and spring birthday parties to attend. To the last point, my friend and fellow blogger had a gathering on Friday. Be sure to check him out at his blog <a href="https://illmakeamanoutofyou.wordpress.com" target="_blank">I&#8217;ll Make a Man Out of You</a>. It is a lot of fun and he is a fantastic writer.

Anyway, he was having people over for drinks, dinner, and fun times to celebrate his birthday. I knew that there would be people who were both Gluten Free as well as Vegetarian. I like to be the person that can and does bring something that most people can have. I figure that since at a pot-luck there usually aren&#8217;t a lot of options for people with restricted diets that I can bring something that they can eat. I enjoy experimenting with different dishes and I do like to have a variety in my diet. While I have neither dietary restriction I do enjoy variety and being able to share my cooking endeavors.
