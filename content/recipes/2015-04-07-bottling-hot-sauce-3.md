I spent some time bottling some delicious homemade hot sauce. These were made from peppers that I had grown last summer and that had been lacto-fermenting in the basement for the past few months. The peppers had been de-stemmed and packed in a ~5% salt brine with other ingredients to ferment. I made two sauces, one red and one green. The green sauce has jalape√±o, big jim, mariachi, and arbol peppers along with carrots (not blended), onion, mustard seed, and black peppercorn. The red sauce was made with thai chilis, garlic, onion, carrots (blended), riesling, and spices.

Once the were ready, in this case spring break when I had time, I took the now pickled veggies out, blended, and strained them.

Once I had strained out the pepper mash I pasteurized it

And then bottled the resulting hot sauce.

Yum! And both are delicious!
