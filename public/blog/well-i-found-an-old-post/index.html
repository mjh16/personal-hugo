    Well, I found an Old Post

</div>

            <div class="markdown">
                <p>I found an old post sitting in drafts, and it made me realize that I have really been meaning to keep up with this whole blog thing, at least somewhat regularly. I mean, it is part of the reason that I have the site, right? It is a good place to keep my various digital projects, and I need to upload a CV, but I want it to be more than just that sort of digital clearinghouse. I want to do more with this page, and to have it inhabit the sort of in-between spaces that I inhabit in my work and studies.</p>

<p>So, a new post, wanting to cross between the academic&#8211;the piles of work that I could be doing, but am not&#8211;and the everyday. I&#8217;ve found that I&#8217;m starting to discern where I want to go with this whole PhD thing, and to consider, more specifically, what those areas are and how they interact. I know that I still want to work with creative nonfiction in my work, regardless of context. I also want to continue to weave creative writing into my theory, pedagogy, and curriculum. I&#8217;ve had an immense amount of luck, all anecdotal, this semester with both in my teaching, and I hope some in my work.</p>

<p>I have some projects that are brewing that I&#8217;m excited about, but nothing to share here until I have some proposals out and perhaps some drafts composed. But it is all exciting work, and here&#8217;s a preview: at least 2 conference proposals, a research proposal, a class design, a collaborative article, sending out some CNF pieces to journals, and sending out an article. And this is all in addition to my grading, reading, and writing this semester!</p>

<p>Tallahassee continues to be a wonderful place to be, and Florida State is fan-fucking-tastic. I have thoroughly enjoyed my cohort, my classes, the readings groups, the speakers, and my students. It has been challenging overall, but I am so so so happy that we chose to move here. The weather, parks, food, and beer have also certainly helped. We&#8217;ve been able to find some good places to be and some good things to do.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncte.org/cccc/conv">CCCC 2017 in Portland</a> was cold, rainy, and wonderful. I had my first ever concurrent-session talk and it went great. We probably had ~25 people in attendance, had a lively discussion, and I didn&#8217;t throw up!</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m procrastinating, and I&#8217;ve got my first <a href="http://www.springtime10k.com/index.html">official 10k</a> for the year (and first organized race in Tallahassee) in the morning. So, here&#8217;s to a good 6.2 miles.</p>
