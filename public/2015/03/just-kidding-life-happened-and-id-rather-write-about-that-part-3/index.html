We pick it up here after going to visit her one last time.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mom called at 11:30am on February 15<sup>th</sup> to let us know that grandma had passed away early that morning. She was comfortable and surrounded by family. I spent time on the phone with mom, my sister, and cousins as I arranged for everyone to meet in Omaha Tuesday before heading up to Spencer on Wednesday for the visitation and funeral. By Monday I had talked with all of my professors, let my students know of the situation and adjusted the schedule, arranged for coverage as I could, got my assignments turned in or alternate arrangements made.</p>

<p>My sister arrived in Omaha from Tucson Tuesday afternoon and my cousins arrived from Colorado that evening. We packed wine, clothes, liquor, and beer in the car and left early Wednesday morning to drive the familiar three hours to Spencer.</p>

<p>We stopped for lunch at Cronk’s, a restaurant in Dennison Iowa, at about the halfway point of the drive. We would often stop for lunch at there growing up when we would visit the grandparents or be going to camp at Lake Okiboji. We ordered sandwiches to have with our nostalgia; both were delicious.</p>

<p>It was an optimistic 4 degrees when arrived in Spencer. It would be frigid both days that we spent there. Grandma had picked out a snowy scene of the evergreen trees that formed the windbreak behind the farmhouse to be on the cover of the programs for the funeral. Someone else would have gotten it wrong.</p>

<p>We went over to the funeral home for the visitation at four. When we arrived we knew that the casket would be open but that it would be closed for the funeral the next day, so this was our last chance to see Grandma. Spread behind the casket were flowers that had been sent from near and far. Grandma’s hair was done; she had subtle makeup and looked better than the previous Friday when we had visited. The funeral home had painted her nails bright red; Grandma never painted her nails. We laughed about the fact, with everything else so tastefully and thoughtfully done, that she would have been pissed that they messed up that detail.</p>

<p>A number of people from in and around Spencer came by to offer their condolences and to celebrate her life. Laughs were passed around as frequently as the tissues. The funeral home had put together a remembrance video with a slideshow of pictures that had been found in my grandparent’s apartment. Most of the pictures had been given to Mom and my aunt so they were surprised at what they found. The pictures spanned from when Grandma was a teenager through a picture of her and Grandpa dressed up and wearing the corsages that my sister and brother-in-law had sent on the day of their wedding a year and a half ago. The slideshow included a picture that I had posted to Facebook on the 15<sup>th</sup> of Grandma holding me at three months old during my first Christmas up at the farm. She looked so proud and happy to have a grandson. It looped on a TV that was prominently put out of the way, conspicuous and not distracting.</p>

<p>I remember at my high school graduation Grandma told me that she was happy she lived long enough to see one of her grandchildren graduate high school. She got to see all five of her grandchildren do so. She also got to see my sister and I graduate from college, and she got to experience my her granddaughter getting married, even though they were unable to travel for it. She lived a long, full life surrounded by people that loved her. She got to see more than I can imagine in her lifetime, she lived a life worth something, she mattered. She had impact on generations.</p>

<p>The funeral was held the next morning at the congregational church that they belonged too in Spencer. The funeral was a touching celebration of her life. Grandma even wrote her own eulogy, someone else would have gotten it wrong.</p>
