                <p>So I&#8217;m currently in Minneapolis for the 2015 <a href="https://www.awpwriter.org">awp conference</a> and am having a marvelous time. The picture above is of the bookfair on Thursday morning before it got super crazy. That place has been an overwhelming and amazing experience. I&#8217;ve only walked through maybe a third of it so far between sessions. I plan to spend more time there tomorrow.</p>

<p>Today I got to see some very interesting panels on video essays and things that I actually really enjoy writing and doing, so that was good. It was especially enlightening to hear <a href="http://www.eulabiss.net">Eula Biss</a> and <a href="http://bresland.com">John Breslan </a>talk process for drafting and editing video essays. While I still don&#8217;t agree with all of their choices in their work, having the opportunity to look behind the curtain gave me a deeper understanding and context that I didn&#8217;t get from viewing the work online.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail" title="" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0077.jpg?resize=420%2C315" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span>I&#8217;ve also been able to attend some other really great panels, so expect a fuller report at some point. While stressful in the context of this spring, the conference has been really enlightening and productive. I&#8217;ve especially enjoyed the work that I&#8217;ve seen and heard that tease, in productive ways, at the same borders and boundaries that I&#8217;m interested in. I&#8217;m glad to see that there are others mining the same grey area. <span style="line-height: 28px;"> </span></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also been able to drink some good local beer, so that&#8217;s been awesome.</p>
