      <description>I often find myself cooking for myself and the family. One of the largest adjustments over the past year has been my schedule as a graduate student and teaching assistant. This has led to me having odd hours and not being around as often to cook. Out of this I have made a number of recipes that are quick, easy, flavorful, and pack well as leftovers. This is a barley salad that I made to have as a cold option for lunches throughout a school week.</description>

      <description>This week I decided to make hummus to take to the office to share as a snack and meal accessory. I gathered my supplies and set out to make the two batches: one roasted red pepper and the other garlic.From there it was a quick assembly in my Blendtec Total Blender, blend it, package it, and take it to school with some tortilla chips and some carrots. It&amp;#8217;s been good so far and a great, easy, and healthy snack to bring.</description>

      <description>I spent some time bottling some delicious homemade hot sauce. These were made from peppers that I had grown last summer and that had been lacto-fermenting in the basement for the past few months. The peppers had been de-stemmed and packed in a ~5% salt brine with other ingredients to ferment. I made two sauces, one red and one green. The green sauce has jalape√±o, big jim, mariachi, and arbol peppers along with carrots (not blended), onion, mustard seed, and black peppercorn.</description>

      <description>One thing that I have found very useful, being a GTA, full-time student, and a stay at home son, is to have lunches pre-prepared and packaged. I can&amp;rsquo;t make sammiches everyday, and making them ahead of time and keeping them in the fridge makes them soggy. I have turned to making wraps on Sunday to take throughout the week that use hearty veggies, some protein, and a whole bunch of delicious.</description>
