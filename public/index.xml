      <description>This is a video essay that explores the reasons why I run and specifically why I really enjoy trail running. This was done as a part of the requirements for a CNF in digital environments class, but I quite like the outcome and want to continue working with it.

      <title>A New Space and an Update</title>

      <description>So, there have obviously been some changes here. There are a number of reasons for it, and I will be updating with a longer post eventually. But, there are a number of reasons for the shift, all of which should be good (at least for me, and that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s important).</description>

      <title>Barley, Corn, Black Bean, Kale, and Chipotle Salad</title>

      <description>I often find myself cooking for myself and the family. One of the largest adjustments over the past year has been my schedule as a graduate student and teaching assistant. This has led to me having odd hours and not being around as often to cook. Out of this I have made a number of recipes that are quick, easy, flavorful, and pack well as leftovers. This is a barley salad that I made to have as a cold option for lunches throughout a school week.</description>

      <description>I found an old post sitting in drafts, and it made me realize that I have really been meaning to keep up with this whole blog thing, at least somewhat regularly. I mean, it is part of the reason that I have the site, right? It is a good place to keep my various digital projects, and I need to upload a CV, but I want it to be more than just that sort of digital clearinghouse.</description>

      <description>Well we have officially started our second semester at FSU. We had a wonderful time driving home (despite the 48 hours and 2400 miles in the car), and it was really nice to be able to see everyone. We even went to Krug Park 3 times! And ate La Casa 🙂

      <description>Well, we&amp;#8217;ve moved to Tallahassee. In fact, we&amp;#8217;ve been in our apartment a bit over a month now. It&amp;#8217;s been quite the adventure, right pup?Whatever dude.
In that time we&amp;#8217;ve gotten to meet our great cohort, start teaching, find new places, and then this happened:

Well we are all doing alright, although we still have to settle into life here in Florida. It&amp;#8217;s going to be a good adventure, I&amp;#8217;m just not entirely sure what it will all look like yet.</description>

      <description>Long time, no update. It&amp;#8217;s now the second week of the semester, and it feels like there is a lot that has been accomplished and a lot still left to do.
All of the PhD applications are in! So that is a great feeling. I think that I hit submit on the last one around this time last week. So here&amp;#8217;s to playing the waiting game. It feels good to have things out of my control and know that I did everything to make my applications the best possible.</description>

      <description>Well, this fall semester has been a busy one. I presented at a conference, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing PhD applications, I&amp;#8217;ve been writing a lot, working on a thesis, and teaching two classes. I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to do more here, perhaps I will soon.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Sorry about the long delay, the end of the semester and the beginning of the summer have been fun, busy, and adventure filled. I&amp;#8217;ve also had some idea of how this blog will shape and evolve over the next few months as I do intend to keep updating and adapting it.
Here is a preview of some of the thing that I intend to write about: Trip to Colorado, seeing The Mountain Goats, running the 2015 Bolder Boulder, getting back into running, pizza, bacon, running, salads, gardening, peppers, golf, soup, beer, and the general trajectory of life.</description>

      <title>Easy Pork Chops with Mushroom and Marsala Sauce</title>

      <guid>http://michaelhealy.space/2015/05/easy-pork-chops-with-mushroom-and-marsala-sauce/</guid>
      <description>This is a recipe that I took and adapted for a nice, quick, and easy weeknight meal. It could also serve as a good centerpiece for a date or nicer meal as well. It is relatively quick to prepare, though do be sure to not overcook and dry out the pork. Using bone in chops helps with the flavor. In the future I will serve it will rice or noodles to help soak up some of the sauce.</description>

      <description>A video essay exploring why I love to run and why I seek out dirt trails to do it. This is 1080p so I advise embiggening it for the best viewing experience.

      <description>Me Post Halfsy I was excited about being able to get out for a run yesterday. I spent most of last summer and much of the fall running trails with the GOATZ at places like Tranquility, Swanson,Lewis and Clark, Hitchcock, and others. These are all parks in the Greater Omaha Area that have dirt trails that are great for running. Through the GOATZ I&amp;#8217;ve met a bunch of awesome people who pushed me into the best shape of my life.</description>

      <description>It is that time of year again, when the paper deadlines are here, there are papers to grade, and spring birthday parties to attend. To the last point, my friend and fellow blogger had a gathering on Friday. Be sure to check him out at his blog _I&amp;#8217;ll Make a Man Out of You. _It is a lot of fun and he is a fantastic writer.
Anyway, he was having people over for drinks, dinner, and fun times to celebrate his birthday.</description>

      <description>Jessi and I made some pizzas for entertaining over the weekend. She made the dough and I took care of many of the topping choices. We made two pizzas, one with sausage, salami, and veggies and the other with bacon, apple, and brie.Bacon, apple, and brie pizza assembly
Both ended up delicious, with good leftovers, and were well enjoyed! We served them with a red and a white wine (I will have to ask what) and they paired well.</description>

      <description>This week I decided to make hummus to take to the office to share as a snack and meal accessory. I gathered my supplies and set out to make the two batches: one roasted red pepper and the other garlic.From there it was a quick assembly in my Blendtec Total Blender, blend it, package it, and take it to school with some tortilla chips and some carrots. It&amp;#8217;s been good so far and a great, easy, and healthy snack to bring.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;#8217;m currently in Minneapolis for the 2015 awp conference and am having a marvelous time. The picture above is of the bookfair on Thursday morning before it got super crazy. That place has been an overwhelming and amazing experience. I&amp;#8217;ve only walked through maybe a third of it so far between sessions. I plan to spend more time there tomorrow.
Today I got to see some very interesting panels on video essays and things that I actually really enjoy writing and doing, so that was good.</description>

      <description>I spent some time bottling some delicious homemade hot sauce. These were made from peppers that I had grown last summer and that had been lacto-fermenting in the basement for the past few months. The peppers had been de-stemmed and packed in a ~5% salt brine with other ingredients to ferment. I made two sauces, one red and one green. The green sauce has jalapeño, big jim, mariachi, and arbol peppers along with carrots (not blended), onion, mustard seed, and black peppercorn.</description>

      <description>[][1]Grandma is on the left. No date for the picture. My 93-year-old grandmother had a fall and was put into hospice care, as discussed in part 1 and part 2 of this series. We pick it up here after going to visit her one last time.
Mom called at 11:30am on February 15th to let us know that grandma had passed away early that morning. She was comfortable and surrounded by family.</description>

      <description>One thing that I have found very useful, being a GTA, full-time student, and a stay at home son, is to have lunches pre-prepared and packaged. I can&amp;rsquo;t make sammiches everyday, and making them ahead of time and keeping them in the fridge makes them soggy. I have turned to making wraps on Sunday to take throughout the week that use hearty veggies, some protein, and a whole bunch of delicious.</description>

      <description>As I explained in my previous post, my grandmother passed away recently and I wanted to explore that. We had left off with me sitting with grandma in hospice.
Mom leaned towards grandma and said, “do you remember your time at University?”
Grandma perked up and looked towards my mother while a little smile turned up the corners of her mouth. My mom motioned for me to grab my iPad with the pictures I had received from the UNO archive.</description>

      <description>I would like to spend some time here exploring the sickness and death of my grandmother and how being a stay-at-home son affected that experience. I hope that by meaningfully reflecting I can share useful insights into dealing with grief. The ultimate purpose of the blog was to give some understanding into being a stay at home son, and to bring some dignity to moving back home. I feel that this can be illuminating into the shifting family dynamics and responsibilities involved in moving home as an adult as well as dealing with the death of a grandparent.</description>

      <description>I came home yesterday to find my mother waist deep in my brother’s room attempting to clean out the smell of stale soda, vaping (roasted fruit-loop marshmallow), and dog. She had cleared out some space and was vacuuming an aisle between piles of clothes and computer parts. When I asked what she was doing she responded that the room was gross, reeked of dog, and “anyway, it’s my house.”
My brother had left for the afternoon and my mother had gone to let his dog out when she had reached her breaking point.</description>

Dad had a beer and mom already had a glass of wine. We sat down and discussed our days while waiting for my brother to show up. Once he showed up and ordered drinks we settling in for an appetizer of bruschetta (good) and an order of brussel sprouts (holy SHIT amazing!</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal space web space. Here you can find my blog, recipes, and to things that I&amp;rsquo;ve composed. There is also a link to my academic space, which details my publications, presentations, research, and class projects. I&amp;rsquo;ve set up the two seperately so that each has a unique look and feel, and that I can best keep track of the two.
So, welcome, have a look around. I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding some bread recipes soon, as well as updating some of the rest.</description>
