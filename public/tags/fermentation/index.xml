      <description>I spent some time bottling some delicious homemade hot sauce. These were made from peppers that I had grown last summer and that had been lacto-fermenting in the basement for the past few months. The peppers had been de-stemmed and packed in a ~5% salt brine with other ingredients to ferment. I made two sauces, one red and one green. The green sauce has jalape√±o, big jim, mariachi, and arbol peppers along with carrots (not blended), onion, mustard seed, and black peppercorn.</description>
