      <description>I often find myself cooking for myself and the family. One of the largest adjustments over the past year has been my schedule as a graduate student and teaching assistant. This has led to me having odd hours and not being around as often to cook. Out of this I have made a number of recipes that are quick, easy, flavorful, and pack well as leftovers. This is a barley salad that I made to have as a cold option for lunches throughout a school week.</description>
